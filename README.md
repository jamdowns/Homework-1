# SEO Coding Refactor Project

## Description

In this project I was asked to improve upon code given to me in order tro improve SEO. I made a number of change to both the CSS and HTML files to achieve this

## What Was Changed?

Upon reviewing the code given to me, the first thing that stood out was the excessive use of div tags to separate this so I cleaned this up by using main, article, section, and aside. I then made sure the CSS reflected these changes while also removing some repeated items by using class and id tags appropriately.

## What Does It Look Like?
